## Hello to all programming enthusiasts!<a name="hello"/>

As someone who is taking their first steps in the world of Python, I came across a resource that I consider a goldmine for novices like me. Recently, I stumbled upon a video titled ["Uses and Integrations of Optional Static Typing in Python"][video-link], presented by the experts at Codurance Spain, and I thought it would be an excellent idea to share my discoveries with you.

## A Glimpse into the Content<a name="content"/>

In this workshop, the presenters, Javier Mart√≠nez Alc√°ntara and Pablo Mart√≠nez, guide us through the basic concepts and best practices of optional static typing in Python. Although I am new to this field, I found the way they explain the concepts to be quite accessible, even for someone who is just starting out like me.

The video begins with a warm welcome from the presenters, who quickly immerse us in the world of typing in Python. The session is designed to be collaborative and aims to provide value to both novices and the community at large.

## What is Optional Static Typing?<a name="optional"/>

Before diving into the technical details, let me share with you what I have learned about optional static typing. In Python, a "type" is defined as a set of values along with a set of operations that can be applied to those values. This concept was first introduced in the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 483.

To illustrate this concept, the presenters use the example of different types of train tickets, where each type of ticket allows different operations, such as seat changes or cancellations. This simple but effective example makes it easier to understand how the available operations can define a type.

## Why is it Important?<a name="important"/>

As someone who is learning, I realized that understanding typing can be a powerful tool for designing and programming our applications more effectively and professionally. Moreover, this workshop is just the beginning, as it is part of a series that addresses different aspects of programming in Python, which means there is much more to learn.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"/>

Although I am still in the early stages of my Python learning journey, I found this video to be an excellent introduction to optional static typing in Python. I invite everyone who is interested in learning Python to watch this video, as it offers a great opportunity to learn from experts in the field.

As a teaser for my next post, I'm excited to delve into the world of [Mojoüî•][mojo-link], a programming language designed for AI development. It promises the ease of Python with the performance of C, making it a fascinating topic for anyone interested in AI and programming. Stay tuned for an in-depth look at what Mojoüî• has to offer!
